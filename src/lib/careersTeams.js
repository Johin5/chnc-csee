// ─── Team groups — careers page team switcher ────────────────────────────────
// Members are referenced by the exact `name` in teamRoster.js, so photos and
// roles stay in one place. A person can appear in more than one group.
//
// `openings` is the live vacancy list for that team and the single source for
// the marquee above it — add a role here and it appears in both places.
// Every opening carries `employmentType` + `experience` (shown on role cards,
// job pages and JobPosting JSON-LD). Experience values marked "authored" were
// not in the source copy doc and need client sign-off.
//
// Blurbs are the approved department copy from the Aug 2026 website content
// doc (all except Production, which the doc doesn't cover). The groupings were
// inferred from job titles — correct any name into the right list and the UI
// follows.
