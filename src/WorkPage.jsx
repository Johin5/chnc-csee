    headline: 'How CHNC unified eight services into a single command-centre dashboard, cutting operator onboarding time by 60%.',
    intro: 'The CHNC platform had grown organically across eight product verticals. Navigation was fragmented, data was siloed, and operators were spending more time switching contexts than executing strategy. We were tasked with designing a unified interface that felt as powerful as it looked.',
    challenge: 'A fractured product experience was slowing down operators and masking the platform\'s true capability.',
    challengeBody: 'With eight distinct modules built by separate teams, the platform lacked a shared design language. Onboarding new operators took weeks. Power users had to maintain mental maps across six different nav structures. The cost of context-switching was real and measurable.',

    headline: 'Building a brand identity that communicates convergence, ambition, and technological authority in a single mark.',
    intro: 'CHNC needed a visual identity that could carry weight across a B2B SaaS platform, enterprise pitch decks, and street-level marketing. The identity had to feel premium without feeling distant — authoritative without feeling cold.',
    challenge: 'No brand system existed. Every touchpoint was inconsistent, eroding trust with enterprise buyers.',
    challengeBody: 'Stakeholders across verticals were producing materials independently, resulting in five different logo treatments, three colour palettes, and no typographic consistency. The brand was invisible where it needed to be loudest.',

    headline: 'A modular collateral system that lets any team produce on-brand materials without a designer in the loop.',
    intro: 'Marketing velocity was being throttled by design bottlenecks. Every sales deck, one-pager, and event banner had to pass through a two-person design team. We built a template system that put production power in the hands of the people closest to the customer.',
    challenge: 'Sales cycles were stalling because custom collateral took too long to produce.',
    challengeBody: 'The design team was a single point of failure for every client-facing asset. A bespoke pitch deck took 4–6 business days. Event materials were routinely off-brand. The pipeline was suffering in silence.',

    challenge: 'Video content was ad hoc, inconsistent, and consistently underperforming on paid channels.',
    challengeBody: 'Three separate agencies had produced product videos over two years, each with different visual treatments. Click-through rates on paid social were below industry benchmarks. The platform\'s speed and intelligence were simply not coming through on screen.',

    challenge: 'High traffic, low conversion. The site was generating awareness it couldn\'t close.',
    challengeBody: 'Session data showed users spending time on the platform overview pages but dropping before reaching the demo CTA. The value proposition wasn\'t landing. Enterprise buyers were leaving with questions the site never answered.',

    challenge: 'Breaking into a commoditised market where price is assumed to be the only differentiator.',

The result was a brand that felt fragmented despite its scale. We designed and produced an integrated campaign architecture that brought everything under a single visual and strategic framework.',

    challengeBody: 'Investors interacting with Kotak MF across touchpoints were receiving subtly different brand signals — different tones, different visual hierarchies, different calls to action.

We designed and executed an influencer-led content and performance campaign strategy that met prospective students on the platforms they actually live on — with creative that felt native, not sponsored.',
    challenge: 'Legacy advertising formats were failing to reach or convert a digitally native student audience.',
    challengeBody: 'Aptech\'s media mix skewed heavily toward broadcast and OOH — formats with low measurability and poor resonance with 18–24 year olds. Digital spend was being deployed without a coherent influencer or content strategy. Cost per enrolment was rising while lead quality declined.',
